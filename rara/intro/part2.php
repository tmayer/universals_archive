<p class="headline">2. The Coverage:  Universals</p>

<p class="introText">
What is being documented in THE UNIVERSALS ARCHIVE are linguistic universals.  
This notion is neither trivial nor self-explanatory;  still, a few remarks will 
have to suffice here concerning what is and is not covered by the archive.
</p>

<p class="introText">
First, although the dividing line is sometimes difficult to draw, to qualify for 
inclusion in the archive universals ought to be substantive rather than being 
"design features", whose universality is definitional (such as vocal-auditory 
channel, evanescence, duality of patterning; see HOCKETT 1963):  lacking them, 
a communication system, instead of being considered a counterexample, would not 
be called a natural "language"<sup><a href="#note3" name="anchor3" title="Footnote #3">3</a></sup>.   
</p>

<p class="introText">
Second, the substantive universals that are entered in the archive are statements 
preceded by a universal quantifier ranging over all natural languages;  and in their 
basic form, which is not always easy to discern, they are either unconditional ("For 
all languages, there is or is not p") or conditional, and in particular 
implicational, prescribing co-variation of two or more logically independent 
variables ("For all languages, if there is or is not p, then there will or will 
not be q").  Thus, to be universal, properties must be universally shared or, if 
they are not shared by all languages, they must not vary independently across the 
domain of all languages.  This is a somewhat restrictive notion of universality, 
favouring a conception of universal grammar as the intersection of particular 
grammars rather than as their union set, this latter set being the grand repository 
of anything that any language is free to select.  
</p>

<p class="introText">
Third, universals are often conceded even by their proponents to be mere tendencies 
rather than categorical laws;  such statistical universals are entered in the 
archive, unlike those regularities explicitly claimed to be limited to areas or 
families (Euroversals, Bantuversals, and the like).  
</p>

<p class="introText">
Fourth, laws are timeless;  still, it is possible for universals to have a time 
dimension - as in claims that whenever a language has a particular property, it must 
have acquired it in a particular way and from a particular source. 
</p>

<p class="introText">
Fifth, going again for archiving liberality, the properties figuring in the 
universals documented include all conceivable kinds of units, categories, 
constructions, rules, constraints, principles, or relationships between them, 
regardless of how concrete or abstract, theory-neutral or theory-bound.
</p>

We cannot here broach the issue of whether universals which do not hold for sign 
languages are to be considered substantive (and invalid) or definitional.
