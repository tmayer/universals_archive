6.  Archive Yourselves
</p>

<p class="introText">
THE UNIVERSALS ARCHIVE currently includes over 2,000 entries, and is constantly 
being overhauled and updated<sup><a href="#note4" name="anchor4" title="Footnote #4">4</a></sup>.   
Since much relevant literature has so far remained 
unread by the local archivists, and some has no doubt been misread, the coverage 
of structural areas is patchy, and what is covered may fall short of perfection.  
To bring the archive up to scratch we solicit the cooperation of the typological 
community.  We welcome constructive comments of all kinds.  And in particular:  
Do send in, or correct, your own universals and those of your friends and enemies - 
or at any rate counterexamples to those of the latter!

In the interest of documenting not only the constraints on, but also the possibilities of 
crosslinguistic diversity, there are also plans to have a separarte department of 
the archive devoted to the opposite of universals ? namely, rara, rarissima, and 
nonesuches.  See now DAS GRAMMATISCHE RARITÄTENKABINETT at ???.
