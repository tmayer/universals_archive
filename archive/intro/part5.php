5. Linking Implications
</p>

<p class="introText">
Sometimes a single conditional universal itself involves more than two variables.  
The best-known instances are claims that a pattern - such as agreement (cf. 
universal #45), relativization, number distinction, or palatalization (#1287 above) 
- follows a hierarchy with several positions.  Otherwise, however, information 
about how individual universals link up to form whole chains and networks, thus 
defining "the great underlying ground-plans of language" (that "tout se tient" 
is unlikely), is far less convenient to extract from THE UNIVERSALS ARCHIVE.  
Lacking a suitable programme, it is so far only by hand that local as well as 
distant users can piece together implications as in the following examples.

Examples
</p>

<pre>
(1) 	#671 	IF basic order is SOV, THEN question particles are almost always 
		sentence-final;  IF basic order is not SOV, THEN question particles tend 
		to be sentence-initial.  (Ultan 1978)
	#495  	Provided that question particles or affixes are positioned relative 
		to the sentence as a whole, IF they are initial, THEN there are prepositions, 
		and IF they are final, THEN there are postpositions.  (Greenberg 1963) 
		thus: 	SOV => Sent Q => Postp;
		not SOV (=>) Q Sent => Prep  [less secure];
		from which follows, since implication is transitive:
		SOV => Postp;
		not SOV => Prep  [less secure];
		which encouragingly fits in with:
	#491  	IF basic order is SOV, THEN with overwhelmingly more than chance frequency 
		there are postpositions.  (Greenberg 1963)
 
(2) 	#615  	IF there is switch-reference marking, THEN basic order is mostly 
		verb-final.  (Haiman & Munro 1983)
	#438  	IF basic order is verb-initial or free, THEN head-marking is favored, 
		and vice versa. IF basic order is verb-medial or verb-final, THEN dependent-
		marking is favored, and vice versa.  (Nichols 1992)
	#437  	IF there is ergative alignment, THEN there will be dependent-marking, 
		and vice versa. IF there is stative-active or hierarchical alignment, THEN 
		there will be head-marking, and vice versa.  (Nichols 1992)
		thus: 	switch-reference => verb-final => dependent-marking <=> ergative alignment.
 
(3) 	#627  	IF there is Suffixaufnahme, THEN basic order is verb-initial or 
		verb-final.  (Plank 1995)
	#438  	IF basic order is verb-initial or free, THEN head-marking is favored, 
		and vice versa. IF basic order is verb-medial or verb-final, THEN dependent-
		marking is favored, and vice versa.  (Nichols 1992)
	#896 	IF there is head-marking, THEN adjectives tend to be grammatically similar 
		to verbs;  IF there is dependent-marking, THEN adjectives tend to be 
		grammatically similar to nouns.  (Dixon 1997)
	#801 	IF adjectives are nouny, THEN verbs are tensed;  IF adjectives are 
		verby, THEN verbs are not tensed.  (Stassen 1997)
	#1031	Tensedness correlates with OV, Casedness of nouns, AND construction, 
		absolute converbs;  Non-Tensedness correlates with VO, Non-Casedness, WITH 
		construction, no absolute converbs.  (Stassen 1997)
		thus: 	Suffixaufnahme & verb-initial => head-marking => verby adjectives => 
		verbs non-tensed =>nouns non-cased => WITH construction => no absolute converbs
		OR Suffixaufnahme & verb-final => dependent-marking => nouny adjectives => 
		verbs tensed =>nouns cased => AND construction => absolute converbs; 
		which fits in with:
	#664  	IF converbs are prominent, THEN basic order is OV, and vice versa.  
		(Haspelmath 1995)
 
(4) 	#635  	IF there is Suffixaufnahme, THEN nominal inflection is agglutinative. 
		(Plank 1995)
	#589 	IF morphology is agglutinative, THEN there is no grammatical gender. 
		By transposition:  IF there is grammatical gender, THEN morphology is not 
		agglutinative.  (Meinhof 1936, Renault 1987, Moravcsik 1994)
	#247 	IF there is an accusative case distinct from a nominative, THEN there 
		is grammatical gender.  
		By transposition:  IF there is no grammatical gender, THEN there is no 
		accusative distinct from a nominative.  (Palmaitis 1987)
	#440 	IF alignment is non-accusative, THEN verb-initial basic order is favoured.  
		(Nichols 1992)
		thus: 	Suffixaufnahme => agglutinative (nominal) morphology => no gender => 
		no nominative-accusative case marking => verb-initial favoured;
		which fits in with:
	#627  	IF there is Suffixaufnahme, THEN basic order is verb-initial or verb-final.
	  	(Plank 1995)
	#638 	IF there is Suffixaufnahme, THEN alignment is ergative or otherwise 
		non-accusative.  (Plank 1995)

<p class="introText">
Often enough, when implications which are entered individually in the archive are 
connected, and transitivity is employed to link directly variables which are only 
linked indirectly in such chains, there is no encouragement but cause for concern. 
However, discovering inconsistencies through such uses of the archive is just as 
well, since at this stage of the typological enterprise only few universals can 
rightfully shed the epithet "putative".
