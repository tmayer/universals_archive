<p class="introText">
THE UNIVERSALS ARCHIVE aims to be a comprehensive documentation of the linguistic 
universals on record.  Currently including over 2,000 entries, it has for some time 
now been available on the internet as a searchable database. For its updating and 
overhaul the cooperation of the typological community is solicited.  Here we outline 
what kind of information is held in the archive and how it can be accessed and used.

<p class="headline">1. The Remit</p>

<p class="introText">
Typology is about how languages, or rather their grammars and lexicons, can and 
cannot differ from each other, and universals are the laws regulating crosslinguistic
variation.  Although the typological research programme has been under way for 
several centuries now, there is regrettably little awareness of just how many such 
putative laws have been accumulating.  Often what comes to mind, even that of many 
a practicing typologist, is little more than (a subset of) the 40 or so universals 
suggested in GREENBERG (1963) and conveniently collected in the appendix of this 
modern classic.  Perhaps, if universals had been named after their discoverer as 
laws are in other sciences (even when they are so unlawlike as Saussure?s Law and 
other such diachronic regularities, limited in scope to particular families or indeed
languages), their impact would have been greater.  In actual fact, there are 
laws galore on record, though few have been officially passed by the typological 
legislature and no systematic effort has ever been made at proper codification.  
In view of their significance for the field, these scattered laws, whatever their 
substance and quality, deserve to be collected and recorded and to be made 
available for ready consultation.

<p class="introText">
Occasionally, more or less narrowly circumscribed selections of universals 
have indeed been catalogued, notably in BURQUEST ET AL. (1982), KIRBY (1995), 
and PLANK (1998)<sup><a href="#note1" name="anchor1" title="Footnote #1">1</a></sup>.   Within the national typology programme of the Deutsche 
Forschungsgemeinschaft, initiated in 1996, a more comprehensive effort in this 
direction has been made by the project "Sprachbaupläne", based at the Fachbereich 
Sprachwissenschaft of the Universität Konstanz<sup><a href="#note2" name="anchor2"
title="Footnote #2">2</a></sup>.   The remit of this project 
was to document existing universals, no matter how hypothetical their validity, 
and not to suggest new ones:  a putative universal needed to be in print, or at 
least be forthcoming, in order to get into THE UNIVERSALS ARCHIVE.  All that was 
added when a universal was being archived were comments of various sorts, contributed
by the archivists or again drawn from the literature.  Although this collection of 
published universals was far from complete and the documentation of those already 
collected sometimes lacked polish, THE UNIVERSALS ARCHIVE was made available as a 
searchable database on the internet in 1999, as a tool for typologists and as an 
invitation for its further extension and refinement.  What follows is a brief 
introduction of this archive for the special benefit of those who are accessing 
it at this address:
