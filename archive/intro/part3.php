3. Guide Through an Archive Under Construction 
</p>

<p class="introText">
To get started on our guided tour, the following universal, one of Moravcsik?s 
Many Laws, serves to illustrate what kind of information is maximally provided 
in an entry in the archive.
</p>

<p class="introText">
For identification, entries are serially numbered, reflecting the order in 
which universals have been entered.  Universals which are thematically related 
can be found and collected together by following up cross-references in the 
Comments section.  Of course, when searching for particular domains or keywords, 
this will define thematic subsets of universals in the first place.
</p>

<p class="introText">
The documentary part of an entry begins with the field Original, where the 
universal is reproduced approximately as stated in the original source.  For 
various reasons, including readability and limitations of space, it is not 
always advisable to reproduce the source literally.  Also, we translate into 
English even when source languages are among the more widely read ones (such 
as Russian).  Subsequently the original statement is, if necessary, standardized 
in style and terminology.  Such transformations are always meaning-preserving, 
and sometimes meaning-enhancing.  It is these Standardized versions that are 
recommended to archive users for all practical purposes.  Ideally they ought 
to be Authorized Versions, but obtaining authorization has so far not always 
proved viable.  (So far as possible, we continue trying.)
</p>

<p class="introText">
We had intended to standardize and indeed formalize universals yet further;  
but this has largely remained a task for the future.  Presently the field Formula 
is of little utility, and is best ignored by users.
</p>

<p class="introText">
The fields Keywords and Domain classify universals by content at different 
levels of generality.  At the highest level we currently distinguish these 
domains and domain-combinations: 
</p>

<p class="introText">
syntax, morphology (sometimes differentiated as inflection and word formation), 
phonology (sometimes specified as prosodic phonology), phonetics, semantics, and 
lexicon. Lower-level keywords are devised as we go along. 
</p>

<p class="introText">
A separate inventory of keywords, categorizing universals at lower levels is 
available for the benefit of on-line searchers of the archive.  Further keywords 
are devised as we go along archiving.
</p>

<p class="introText">
The following three fields Type, Status, and Quality classify universals by kind.
</p>

<p class="introText">
The basic "types" of universals are unconditional (like #1181, a lexical one, for 
a change) or conditional.  The most important conditional relationship is that of 
material implication (one-way or mutual);  but from the way relationships are 
sometimes named and characterized in the sources (e.g., "p correlates with q", 
"p and q are mutually conducive", "p favours q", "p authorizes q") it is not always 
easy to determine whether this is the intended reading.  Here (and perhaps 
further in the field Comments) attention is also drawn to possibly misleading 
formulations of universals as implications in the original source.  Not infrequently,
what is given in the form of an if-then statement is not really a material 
implication but a kind of conditional relationship which is paraphrasable as 
"q, provided/given that p".  Implications can be transposed under negation of 
both implicans and implicatum:  "if p then q" is equivalent with "if not q then 
not p" (e.g., "if there is a trial, then there is a dual" = "if there is no dual, 
then there is no trial");  if relationships fail the test of transposition, they 
are not genuine implications, or need some tinkering to reveal their implicational 
essence. Universals ##12 and 170 are examples.
</p>

<p class="introText">
Status is about the historical nature of universals.  When they are purportedly 
of timeless validity, proscribing or prescribing structures independent of previous 
or later states of a language, they are referred to as "achronic".  "Diachronic" 
universals are laws of change, linking structures of an earlier with those of a 
later stage of a language and perhaps specifying a mechanism of how to get from 
one to the other.  The problem is that these labels are frequently a matter of 
interpretation, and ultimately raise profound questions about the relationship 
between typology and diachrony (see e.g. PLANK 1999, PLANK & SCHELLINGER 2000).  
Without going into this issue here, we refer back to #31 as an example of a 
universal that is clearly intended as (and presumably indeed is) achronic.  
So is #17, while #38 is clearly intended as diachronic;  and this pair goes to 
show how intricately achronic and diachronic universals may be related to each 
other, with the latter potentially rendering the former redundant.  Universal 
#1287 posits hierarchies which are equally meaningful as timeless crosslinguistic 
constraints on segment inventories and as steps in the historical spreading 
within a language of the process in question, with the author of the universal 
himself wavering between an achronic and a diachronic reading.
