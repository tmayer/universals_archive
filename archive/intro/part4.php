4. Some Advice for Users at a Distance
</p>

<p class="introText">
THE UNIVERSALS ARCHIVE is a FileMaker Pro 4.1 database.  This software is easy 
to deal with and serves the intended purposes reasonably well.  In particular, 
without much ado it enables users of the archive to do and to see at a distance 
what can be done and seen locally.  One crucial difference, however, is that those 
visiting the archive on the internet cannot alter the database directly;  if this 
is what they desire, they have to prompt the archivists to take local action.  
And, annoying locals no less than visitors, formatting and special characters do 
not transmit well on the web.  We tend to use Symbol and PalPhon to supplement 
the standard font (Times) whenever needed, especially in phonological/phonetic 
and semantic universals, but visitors may not be able to see it (yet, pending 
Unicode), even if they choose the same fonts on their screens.  Profuse apologies.
</p>

<p class="introText">
Visitors can access THE UNIVERSALS ARCHIVE in two different ways.  They can 
browse through it or they can search it for anything they hope to be in it.  
To familiarize themselves with what they can reasonably expect to find, it is 
recommended that they first browse a bit, scrolling through the myriad universals 
in chunks of ten.  To improve user-friendliness, there will in future be pop-up 
windows in particular for keywords, the likeliest guides for systematic searches.  
(To the same end, it is planned to add links from references given in individual 
universals files to the separate bibliographies for universals sources and for 
counterexamples and comments.)
</p>

<p class="introText">
When browsers turn searchers, they can retrieve universals in terms of any string 
of symbols or of any combinations of symbol strings which occur in any field of a 
universals file, from Number to Comments.  If they simultaneously want to search for 
items from more than one field (e.g., Original and Domain), they need to determine 
whether they should be joined with "AND"or "OR".  As is likewise explained on the 
web page, searchers then only need to enter the item(s) to be searched for in the 
relevant right-hand field(s) and click on "Search" below.  There are two options 
for searching, to be determined in the pull-down menus of the left-hand fields:  
"begins with" looks for any words beginning with the character strings entered 
(e.g., "case" in the fields Original or Standardized will find you files where 
"case", "cases", and "case system" occur in these fields;  "aggl" will find you 
"agglutination", "agglutinative", and "agglutinating";  "num" will find you 
"number", "numeral", and, who knows, "numerology", "numinous", "numbskull"), 
while "is" only looks for words exactly identical with the term you enter.
</p>

<p class="introText">
Within one field, any number of words can be entered, separated by blanks.  This 
is a possibility that will be particularly appreciated by typologists, who are 
after all out to discover co-variation, and for co-variation you need (at least) 
two variables.  For example, if you are curious whether switch-reference has 
been claimed to co-vary with anything about the order of any kind of elements, 
simply enter these two words (switch-reference order) in any of the fields 
"Keywords", "Original", or "Standardized" and click on "Search" ? and the archive 
will return you three files, ##613, 614, and 615.  Those who suspect that tone 
somehow correlates with case (e.g., with the number of tones inversely proportional
to that of cases), and type in these two words together, will be pleased 
(or disappointed) to discover that no one before them has gone on record with 
such a suspicion, to the best of the archivists? current knowledge.
